# Coursera-Machine-Learning-with-Python
Welcome to Machine Learning with Python! 
Final project of IBM's course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python on coursera.The following algorithms are used to build models for the different datasets: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression. The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score, Log Loss.
